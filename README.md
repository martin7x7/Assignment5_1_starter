# Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?

## What is the problem?
This project aims to understand the differences between customers who accept the driving coupon and those who do not. Most of data analysis is done with subset of data – bar coupons.

## There are two main files
1)	prompt.ipynb – contains requested code and answers to all questions
2)	coupons.csv – contains data that were analyzed
3)	LICENSE - license file

## Main conclusions from data analysis
1)	The average acceptance rate of coupons is 56.84%. However, bar coupons were accepted in 41.0% cases. Bar coupons are not among the most frequently used.
2)	Those customers who go to bars at least 4 times a month accept bar coupons twice as often as others. 
3)	Those customers who visit bars at least once a month and are over the age of 25 accept coupons twice as much (69% rate) compared to others (33.5% rate).
4)	Probably those who drive with friends or partner are more willing to accept a coupon for a bar than others.
5)	Respondents with lower income who go to cheap restaurants seem less interested in visiting bars (acceptance rate 45.3%). In contrast, there is much higher acceptance rate among those who are used to go to bar at least once a month, travel with partner or friends, or are under the age of 30.

## Recomendations for next steps
My recommendation would be to review the data on other types of coupons — Carry Out & Take Away, Coffee House, Restaurant (20–50), and Restaurant (<20).
